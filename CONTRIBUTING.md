### Issues

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

Because we create a generator you should be specific as possible in your requests. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:
* **.yo-rc.json** - A copy of your `.yo-rc.json` is highly appreciated.
* **Generator Version** - is it a regression?
* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/) or
  [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)) or a unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### Pull requests

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

**Test**  
Please add unit tests for every new feature or bug fix and make sure all tests pass before submitting pull requests. Generator tests are written in [Mocha](http://mochajs.org).  [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) and [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) are used to run unit tests and e2e tests on generated app.
* Run `./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha ./test/*.js` to execute all tests instead of `npm test`. Currently all protractor tests in (2) are excluded from `npm test` due to Travis issue. 
* Add tests into (1) and (2) if there are changes in generated project's structure. 
* Feel free to create new test file for new generator features. Use `mute.js` to generate nice test reports.

  | Test Files | Functionality 
  |:-- |:-- 
  | (1) `test-files-generate.mocha.js` | Test generated app files' content. 
  | (2) `test-gulp-task-inception.mocha.js` | Test `gulp build`, `gulp protractor` & `gulp test` on generated app. This verifies gulp task logic and dependencies.
  | (3) `test-options.mocha.js` | Test default options. 
  | (4) `mute.js` | Mute Yeoman during tests. 
  | (5) `test-import-gen.js` | Test generator directory. 
  | (6) `test-utils.js` | Unit tests for utils.js. 

**Style Guide**  
Please brief yourself on [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js) style guide with two space indent.

**Documentation**  
Add documentation for every new feature, directory structure change. Feel free to send corrections or better docs!

**Branch**  
Must be one of the following:

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation only changes
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing tests
* chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
