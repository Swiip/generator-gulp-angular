### Issues

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

Because we create a generator you should be specific as possible in your requests. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:
* **.yo-rc.json** - A copy of your `.yo-rc.json` is highly appreciated.
* **Generator Version** - is it a regression?
* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/) or
  [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)) or a unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)
