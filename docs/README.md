# Yeoman Gulp-Angular Generator documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the generator. The goal of the generator is to bringing to you a cutting edge project with all technologies and optimization you could want or even you don't know yet that you want!

But it can't and shouldn't match all the requirements of all projects. It's why it's generate a code that you have to make it yours and adapt it to your project.

* [Usage](usage.md) - Installation, main gulp commands, options, parameters...
* [How it Works](how-it-works.md) - Description of all mechanisms in the build process.
* [Suggestion box](suggestion-box.md) - Not a roadmap, just the list of all the ideas we have to add to the project

## Recipes

The community has written [recipes](recipes#recipes) for common use-cases that we chose not to add as a feature of the generator.
